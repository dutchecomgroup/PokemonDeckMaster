üß™ Critical Bug Investigation: Mobile Collection View Missing Cards (Data Mismatch)
There is a serious inconsistency between the desktop and mobile versions of the collection view, and it appears to be a data rendering or filtering bug specific to mobile.

üîç Specific Observations:
On desktop, my collection correctly shows 4 cards.

On mobile, the preview (3-card summary) also appears accurate ‚Äî showing 3 of those cards.

But when I open the full collection view on mobile, only 2 cards are displayed.

‚úÖ What This Tells Us:
The backend is saving all cards correctly.

The mobile preview component uses correct data.

The issue is isolated to the rendering or data logic in the mobile full collection view.

üîç Deep Debug Targets:
1. Mobile Fetching Logic
Ensure that the mobile collection view actually retrieves all cards in the collection, not a limited subset.

Double-check pagination, slice, or filtering conditions ‚Äî e.g., collection.cards.slice(0, 2) might still exist from preview logic.

2. Data Source Differences
The preview and full collection views may use different sources or queries.

Example: preview might pull directly from state or API, while detail view might depend on stale cached data.

3. Screen-Dependent Logic
Look for conditional rendering based on screen width (window.innerWidth, matchMedia, etc.) that may inadvertently limit results on smaller devices.

4. Hidden UI Elements or Rendering Blockers
The missing cards may be in the DOM but hidden, due to:

Overflow issues

Flex/grid layout problems

Conditional styling like display: none or visibility: hidden

5. Card Identity / Mapping Bug
Check if the cards not showing have anything in common:

Different structure, missing fields, or key mismatches.

Possibly they're not passing required props to render fully.

‚úÖ What Needs to Be Fixed:
The mobile collection view must re-fetch the entire collection state, using the same logic as desktop.

Remove any hard-coded limits, preview constraints, or layout conditions affecting rendering.

Add a visual fallback for debugging: show how many cards are expected vs. shown to detect mismatches in future.

üéØ Goal:
The collection view on mobile should show exactly the same cards as desktop.

The preview, detail view, and backend data must all stay in sync ‚Äî with no hidden or skipped cards.
