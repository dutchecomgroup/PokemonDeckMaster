⚙️ First-Load Performance Fix: Cards Flicker or Show Errors Initially
The card adding and loading functionality is now working, but there is still a noticeable performance and visual issue during the first load of a collection or after adding new cards.

❌ Current Issue (First Load Only):
On the initial load of the collection (or right after adding new cards):

Cards first appear with errors, such as “image unavailable” or stuck on “Loading…”

After a short delay, they correct themselves and load normally

This issue does not happen on subsequent loads or after navigating away and back.

It creates a bad first impression and a flickering, unpolished feel — especially when adding multiple cards.

🔍 Likely Cause:
The frontend is rendering cards before the required data (especially image URLs) is available.

There is no loading guard or intermediate state during the very first render.

After the initial render, cached data or synced state corrects the issue, which is why it works fine afterwards.

✅ What Needs to Be Improved:
1. Add a Proper First-Load Guard
Ensure cards don’t render until required fields like imageUrl are ready:

js
Kopiëren
Bewerken
if (!card || !card.image) return <LoadingSkeletonCard />;
Show a skeleton or loading shimmer instead of an error state on first load.

2. Avoid Premature Rendering
Delay rendering each card until the backend response is complete and all metadata is available.

Consider wrapping the grid in a container that waits for all data before showing the cards.

3. Preload or Prefetch Data If Possible
Use caching or prefetching strategies to reduce load time for images and metadata.

Optionally preload known assets on page entry if the collection was recently updated.

4. Limit Layout Reflows
Avoid full-grid flickering by using isolated re-renders and React.memo() or equivalent.

🎯 Goal:
Ensure that the first load of cards appears cleanly, without error placeholders or flickering.

Deliver a fast, smooth experience from the first interaction, with no visible sync delay or correction lag.

Cards should render confidently with complete data, creating a polished feel even on the initial view.
