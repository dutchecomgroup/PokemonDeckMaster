üêõ URGENT: Extreme Lag and Flickering When Loading Cards in a Collection
The issue with card loading is still not fixed, and the experience has become severely slow and unstable ‚Äî especially when viewing a full collection.

‚ùå Current Behavior:
When loading the collection view:

Each card flashes in and out repeatedly, sometimes up to 10 times per card.

It takes an extremely long time for all cards to settle and render properly.

The page becomes visually chaotic ‚Äî feels like a broken loading loop.

This happens even with only a moderate number of cards in the collection.

üîç Likely Causes:
1. Multiple Re-renders per Card
The component responsible for rendering each card may be re-rendering unnecessarily, perhaps due to:

State being updated globally on each card addition or fetch.

No React.memo() or key-based optimization used in lists.

Each card triggering its own fetch or update instead of using batched data.

2. Inefficient Data Fetching
Cards may be fetched individually rather than in bulk.

If each card fetch is asynchronous and uncoordinated, it causes dozens of updates and DOM redraws.

3. Poor Image Load Handling
If image loads trigger layout shifts or forced updates, this can lead to flashing/flickering behavior.

No image caching or preload strategy in place.

4. Incorrect use of useEffect, setState, or rendering keys
A re-fetch loop or an uncontrolled useEffect might be causing cards to load, unload, then reload again.

‚úÖ Fix Recommendations:
1. Batch Load Cards
Fetch all cards in the collection in one request, not per card.

Use a single state update to populate the full grid.

2. Optimize Component Rendering
Use React.memo() or equivalent to prevent unnecessary re-renders of unchanged cards.

Avoid using dynamic key props that change on every render ‚Äî use stable IDs.

3. Use Centralized State & Efficient Grid Rendering
Consider using virtualization libraries (like react-window) if the card list is large.

Store and update all card data at once, not per item.

4. Improve Image Handling
Use loading="lazy" for image tags.

Preload image URLs if known ahead of time.

Use skeletons instead of full reflows when loading cards.

üéØ Goal:
Cards should render once and stay stable, without flashing or bouncing.

The entire collection should load smoothly within seconds, even for many cards.

The UI should not re-render cards repeatedly unless data has changed.
