üêõ Bug: Cards Not Showing in Mobile Collection View, But Visible in Collection Preview
There is a critical inconsistency between the mobile collection overview and the full mobile collection view.

‚ùå Problem Description:
On mobile, when viewing the collections overview, the 3-card preview correctly shows cards that were added ‚Äî even those added from desktop.

However, when opening the full collection view on mobile:

Some of those same cards (especially those added from desktop) do not appear.

The collection appears incomplete or empty, even though the data exists and is shown elsewhere.

On desktop, the full collection view is correct and complete.

‚úÖ What This Confirms:
The cards are stored correctly in the backend.

The collection preview on mobile fetches and displays the correct data.

The issue is isolated to the mobile full collection view, which likely uses different logic for fetching or rendering.

üîç Suspected Causes:
The mobile collection view is not re-fetching the full collection when opened ‚Äî it may rely on a stale or local version of the state.

A slice, limit, or screen-specific query/filter may be restricting the number of cards shown.

The cards may be in the data object but not rendered due to layout, visibility, or conditional rendering issues.

There could be inconsistent fetch logic between the preview view and full detail view.

‚úÖ What Needs to Be Fixed:
Ensure the full collection view on mobile always fetches fresh, complete data from the backend when opened.

Remove or fix any slice(), limit, or viewport-based logic that may unintentionally restrict card display.

Confirm that the mobile detail view and the desktop view use the same data-fetching logic and render structure.

Inspect the rendering logic on mobile: log the number of cards fetched, and ensure all are passed into the card rendering loop.

üéØ Goal:
Make the mobile collection view display the exact same cards as desktop and the overview preview.

Guarantee that cards added from any device are reliably shown on all platforms.

Eliminate any caching, stale state, or layout bugs preventing correct rendering.
